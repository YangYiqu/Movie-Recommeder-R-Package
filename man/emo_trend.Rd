\title{Calculate Emotional Trend Trajectory}
\usage{
emo_trend(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A character string containing the input text.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing the emotional trend trajectory over time.
}
\description{
This function takes a character string as input and returns a plot of the
emotional trend trajectory over time. The function uses sentiment analysis to
calculate the emotional scores of each sentence in the input string, and then
segments the scores into 10 equally-sized sections. The function then finds
the section with the largest emotional fluctuations and another section with
the highest average emotional score, and highlights them in the plot.

# Example 1: Analyzing the emotional trend of a movie review
review <- "This is a fantastic movie! The acting is superb, and the story is
           gripping from beginning to end. I was on the edge of my seat the whole
           time. Highly recommended!"

# Example 2: Analyzing the emotional trend of a news article
article <- "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, with new cases
            and deaths reported every day. Vaccination efforts are ramping up,
            but many people remain hesitant to get vaccinated. Experts say that
            the best way to protect yourself and others is to follow public health
            guidelines and get vaccinated as soon as possible."

# Example 3: Analyzing the emotional trend of a personal diary entry
diary <- "Today was a really tough day. I got into an argument with my boss at
          work, and I feel like I'm not making any progress on my personal
          goals. I'm feeling really discouraged right now, but I know that
          tomorrow is a new day and things will get better."
