Turn that up please, dear. I'll be God damned. I was just wondering if you had found the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett. Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me. Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. Oh, yes. There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. to the Pomeranian Isn't that right, sweetie. I should like to see my drawing. It was a dreadful, heavy thing. she points at the drawing I only wore it this once. It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number? Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away. indicating the drawing You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value. This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw it. The reflection has changed a bit. My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss. No, no. It's fine. I'm curious. Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical. No! It's been 84 years... holds up her hand for silence It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was... I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania. You told me to change. I felt like black. looking at a cubist portrait You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? reading off the canvas Picasso. Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay. Excuse me. Stay back! Don't come any closer! No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. You're distracting me. Go away. Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. The fall alone would kill you. How cold? perplexed No. I know what ice fishing is! You're crazy. Alright. voice quavering Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson. HELP! HELP!! Cal, stop! It was an accident. It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself. Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? My God... Cal. Is it a -- The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming. I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it... I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt. Hello Jack. Could I speak to you in private? Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. Mr. Dawson, I -- Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you. Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion. Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. in a rush I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! she lowers her head Oh God, I am such an utter fool. Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them. Worse I'm afraid. Yes, exactly! If only it were that simple. Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world. What's this? May I? Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are. Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! laughing You're deranged! Well, well... trying to be very adult And these were drawn from life? You liked this woman. You used her several times. smiling I think you must have had a love affair with her... looking up from the drawings You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. And...? girlish and excited You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free! angry in a flash Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... ...or a moving picture actress! So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? A whole ten cents?! looks at the dusk sky Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. turning to him Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it. You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me? smiling at him I think I would. she looks at the horizon And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair. Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson. Shall we go dress, mother? over her shoulder See you at dinner, Jack. Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson. There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal. nodding toward a couple And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course. J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. To making it count. Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this little book. grabs it and reads Increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3. You build the biggest ship in the world and this preoccupies you?! Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly. low, to Jack Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room. low Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being masters of the universe. Jack, must you go? May I cut in, miss? I don't know the steps. Wait... stop! You think a first class girl can't drink? So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. Oooowww! I haven't done that in years. Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless. They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst. A mistake? laughing I did, didn't I? pointing suddenly Look! A shooting star. I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it? Something I can't have. she smiles sadly Goodnight, Jack. And thank you. I was tired. stiffening I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee -- We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy. Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed. Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day! hurt and lost How can you put this on my shoulders? It's so unfair. singing O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard. Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you. Jack, I -- You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. It's not up to you to save me, Jack. I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. Oh, look what I've done. Hello, Jack. I changed my mind. Fabrizio said you might be up -- I'm flying! That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. Will this light do? Don't artists need good light? Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere. Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out. A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean. I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this. she smiles at him Wearing only this. The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll. As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want. Tell me when it looks right to you. I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing. Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night. Come on! Take us down. Quickly, quickly! He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... To the stars. Au contraire, mon cher. Put your hands on me Jack. You're trembling. When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. Could it have damaged the ship? We have to tell Mother and Cal. Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right? Something serious has happened. Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you -- uncertain He couldn't have. But I was with him the whole time. I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. You're certain? Yes, I understand. Thank you. Oh, Mother shut up! Ruth freezes, mouth open Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die. You unimaginable bastard. Goodbye, mother. I'd rather be his whore than your wife. That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd! Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?! No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer. Bottom, left, right. I have it. I'm through with being polite, goddamnit!! I may never be polite the rest of my life! Now take me down!! Left, crew passage. Right, right... right. Jack? Jaaacckk?? Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I know, I know. I didn't. she looks at him I just realized I already knew. There's no key in here. nodding I'll be right back. Hello? Somebody?! Help me! We need help! Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's -- No, let me go! You're going the wrong way! See you there, buster! Will this work? Move aside! Quickly, move aside! If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job with the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to the boat deck... now. The boats are gone! Colonel! Are there any boats left? I'm not going without you. No. Not without you! You jump, I jump, right? We can't leave him. No! Not that way! Come back! Help us! Please! Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews? hugging him And to you, Mr. Andrews. I trust you. It's so cold. What's that? Thank God for you Jack. It's getting quiet. I love you Jack. I'm so cold. I can't feel my body. I promise. I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. \"Come Josephine in my flying machine...\" barely audible Jack. Oh, Jack. I won't let go. I promise. Yes, I lived. How awkward for you. Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is something you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I for you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me. In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased. Is this in any way unclear? Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic. Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley. Dawson. Rose Dawson. Don't come any closer. The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without his help. I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs. You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless, and making each day count.
